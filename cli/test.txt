This is a sample file used for testing the QuantaCrypt Hybrid Encryption System.

The purpose of this file is to demonstrate the end-to-end secure file transfer pipeline,
which combines QKD-based key generation, Post-Quantum KEM key material, hybrid key fusion,
Shamir Secret Sharing, and AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption.

The text inside this file is intentionally repetitive and extended to ensure that the
file size is large enough for meaningful performance benchmarking. The encryption and
decryption time measurements collected from this file will be used to analyze throughput,
overhead, and computational efficiency of the hybrid cryptosystem.

QuantaCrypt is designed to simulate a next-generation secure communication model where
quantum-generated randomness and post-quantum lattice-based security co-exist within a
unified key management architecture. This file serves as a representative payload for
both encryption and secure transfer from server to client.

The system ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the transferred data,
and the decrypted output must always match the original content. Any deviation would
indicate tampering or corruption during transmission.

This file ends with a block of repeating text to increase file size and test the system's
performance under larger payloads.
